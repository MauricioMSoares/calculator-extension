# Calculator Extension
## Version 1.2.2

<p>
  Calculator Extension was created as a study project for me, 
  in order to learn about Chrome Extensions development and 
  practice React, JavaScript and Jest/Vitest.
</p>

### Known Issues
* It currently does not support negative numbers due to the logic I used to build it
  * 1 - 1 -> Succeeds, equals 0.
  * -1 - 1 -> Breaks. The current logic can't read an expression starting with an operator.

### Running Tests
<p>If you'd like to run the tests script present in this project, execute the following command in your bash terminal</p>
```bash
  npm run test
```
